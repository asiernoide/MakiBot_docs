# MakiBot documentation

This is a web application made with the primary purpose of testing out the Reflex framework as well as serving as a help menu to use a Discord bot I made for my own Discord servers. I deployed this web app using Reflex itself in <https://makibot_docs-navy-grass.reflex.run/>. The webpage contains info about all commands available for the MakiBot Discord bot (<https://github.com/asiernoide/MakiBot>).

An old version using Pynecone (the old version of Reflex) is also available at <https://makibot.netlify.app/>.
