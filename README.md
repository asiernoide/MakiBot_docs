# MakiBot documentation

This is a web application made with the Reflex framework, which I deployed using Reflex itself in <https://makibot-docs.reflex.run/>. This webpage contains info about all commands available for the MakiBot Discord bot.
An old version using Pynecone (the old version of Reflex) is also available at <https://makibot.netlify.app/>.
